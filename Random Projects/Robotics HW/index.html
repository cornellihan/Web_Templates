            <h3>Well, I am a tech enthusiast. But it doesn't mean I'm always expert. So in the class or anywhere, I
                don't tell my hobbies cause they think
                I have the full skills. But I know better than anyone else about <b><i>Hardware, Software</i></b> and
                <b><i>Networking</i></b>. And I
                also have fundamental knowledge of <b><i>JavaScript</i></b> and <b><i>Python</i></b> with some data structures.</h3>

                if I said about myself in my Facebook post, then it would look bad. But now what you are
                seeing on your browser is fully my space :)</h3>

                        <h3>Weather detector</h3>
                        <p>It can't be done with one LDR, cause one LDR can get only one sensitivity, so with one LDR, we just can find is it day or night. But if we use another LDR and give it a sensitivity where the high signal is very high sunlight and the low signal is less sunlight, then we can also find how the day is, is it very cloudy or light. So we can also use some extra LDR to get the weather more properly.</p>

                        <p>Well, we can use it anywhere related to temperature. So we can use it inside a blender and the task is if the blender overheats, then the blender will turn off automatically (if it gives an alarm, and we have to off the switch after hearing it, then the machine can burn during this time). So we have to give it a sensitivity where the high signal should be given depending on it's user manual.<p>

                        <h3>Fire Alarm</h3>
                        <p>It's a common thing to use it in our kitchens or any other place where fires can break out. We can put the sensor around the stove. So when the fire will spread around the stove, it will give alarm before the whole kitchen caught fire.</p>

                        <h3>Automatic Irrigation</h3>
                        <p>For this, we have to put the sensor at a certain depth of soil on crop fied and need to arrange a pump. So when the sensor will give low signal to the microcontroller, then it will turn on the pump and irrigate the land.</p>

                        <h3>Automatic Water Faucet</h3>
                        <p>For this, we have to fit a servo motor on water faucet that will turn it on or off and keep the sensor around where the bottle/jug is kept. So when we put the water bottle/jug under the faucet, then the sensor will give high signal and the faucet will be opended by the servo motor.</p>

                        <h3>Gas leak detection in cylinder</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes it happens that for some reason gas leaks somewhere between the cylinder and stove. But we can't find it until we smell it. As a result, we lose some gas or sometimes it can be a big accident. So in this case, we can put some gas sensor around cylinder and the pipe so it gets the smell soon and make an alarm.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I'm sorry again because you probably took longer to see my HW than the other students.</p>
